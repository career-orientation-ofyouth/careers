        <p ><h2>As a part of my Community Servicr Project i have done this survey in my local area and i visited some of the houses of my juniors and students studying 10,intermediate etc... </h2>
        </p>
        <p><h2>
            During my survey i explained all the students about all the courses in detail and i clarified their doubts about the courses and exams...</h2>
        </p>
        <p><h2> 
            During my survey i noticed that most of the students are intrested to join in degree, b.tech(mostly cse) and i asked the reason to them they said that i am very enthusiastic and curious to work as a software developer and i want to invite the many softwares like websites,apps,machines and etc..which are useful to the society.... from this i understood that some students are clear with their courses...
        </h2></p>
        <p><h2 >
            I have given the guidance to the parents , about the courses their children are having...some parents are mostly aware with only b.tech courses like(cse,ece and normal courses) i explained about the most professional courses that comes under the engineering...and explained about diploma courses and exams to get the free seats..and most of the parents are knew about that..... so that i concluded that parents are updated with the latest studies and technologies 
        </h2></p>
        <p><h2 >
            During my survey i visited some of the girls houses.... and i noticed that they are not going to schools i started awareness to them and i reached their parents and guided them to study their children ...they told that we are economically poor and we can't study the children as they are girls we want keep money for their marriages and etc...I guided them about the importance of education mainly for girls to live in this society...and girls education strengthens economics and reduces inequality....
        </h2></p>
        <p><h2 >
            I noticed that most of the students are not aware about the courses they are having and the compititive exams like IEEE....and etc.i have explained about the compititive exams to get the free seats and list of all courses and the professional courses and skills needed to get the job etc.. 
        </h2></p>
        <p><h2> 
             I explained about all the ways there are having at that point ...Choosing a best course depends on your intrest ....In my point of view all courses have their specific role in this world..there is no course that "which is not useful to anyone.." but it depents on your thinking process...first explore yourself and find out which course suits you the best ....
        </h2></p>
        <p><h2 ><strong> <b><i>
            The reason to take this topic is if all study b.tech(cse,ece), and degree courses which relates to software technology then what about the other courses?... Did all the people who study these courses will get the jobs? ..It absolutely 'NO' because compitation will be high....No average student will get the job .... only who has passionate and intrest on that course will only get the job .....so that choose the course on your intrest and rule the world!...so that to explain this criteria i have choosen this topic and i explained the juniors to take the course in which you are passionate to work....
        </i></b></strong></h2></p>
        <p><h3><b><i> <big>
             I think so this website information will leads you to know about all the courses in detail...I hope that by using this information you may choose the good career path ...
